## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Discord Webhook

1. Open your Discord server
2. Right-click on the channel where you want notifications
3. Select **Edit Channel** ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
4. Click **New Webhook**
5. Give it a name (e.g., "SOL Trading Bot")
6. Copy the **Webhook URL**

### Step 2: Add Webhook to .env

Open your `.env` file and add:

```bash
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/YOUR_WEBHOOK_TOKEN
```

Replace with your actual webhook URL from Step 1.

### Step 3: Test the Connection

Run the test script to verify it works:

```bash
python scripts/test_discord_webhook.py
```

You should see "‚úÖ Test notification sent successfully!" and a message in your Discord channel.

### Step 4: Run the Bot

Now when you run the trading bot, it will automatically send notifications:

```bash
python scripts/run_live_bot.py
```

## Disable Notifications

To disable Discord notifications:

1. Remove or comment out the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` line in `.env`
2. Or set it to an empty value: `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=`

The bot will continue to work normally without sending notifications.

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep your webhook URL private!**
- Don't commit `.env` to Git (it's in `.gitignore`)
- Don't share your webhook URL publicly
- Anyone with the URL can send messages to your channel

## Troubleshooting

### "No webhook URL configured"
- Make sure `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is set in your `.env` file
- Check that the URL starts with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`

### "Failed to send notification"
- Verify the webhook URL is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure the webhook hasn't been deleted in Discord

### Notifications not appearing
- Check you're looking at the correct Discord channel
- Verify the webhook is enabled in Discord settings
- Run `test_discord_webhook.py` to test the connection

## Advanced Configuration

The notifications are sent from these functions in `scripts/run_live_bot.py`:
- `execute_buy()` - Called when buying SOL
- `execute_sell()` - Called when selling SOL

You can customize the notification format by editing the `send_discord_notification()` function.

## Next Steps

- ‚úÖ Test the webhook connection
- ‚úÖ Run the bot and wait for trade signals
- üì± Keep Discord open to see real-time notifications
- üìä Monitor your trading performance

Happy trading! üöÄ
